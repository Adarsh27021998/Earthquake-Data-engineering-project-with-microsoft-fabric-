# Earthquake-Data-engineering-project-with-microsoft-fabric-
This earthquake analysis project uses Fabric to ingest raw USGS data daily via Python. Fabric Data Factory orchestrates the scheduled transformation into Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers. Fabric Notebooks handle the data cleaning and transformation. Finally, a Notebook Semantic Model is built on the "Gold" layer for business-ready analysis.
